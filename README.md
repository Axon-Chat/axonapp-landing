[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Welcome to the official repository for the Axon chat application's landing page!

Axon is a modern, highly customizable chat application designed for seamless communication. This repository contains the source code for our beautiful and informative landing page, built to introduce you to the world of Axon.

## üöÄ What's in this repository?

This repository hosts the source code for the **Axon landing page only**. The landing page is built using:

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Vite:** A next-generation frontend tooling that provides a faster and leaner development experience.

The actual Axon chat application, including its backend and client applications, is hosted in separate repositories (links will be provided here once available).

## ‚ú® About Axon (The Full Application)

Axon is more than just a chat app; it's a platform built for flexibility and extensibility. Here are some of its core features:

* **Fully Customizable:** Tailor Axon to fit your specific needs and branding.
* **Robust Rust Backend:** The core of Axon is powered by a high-performance, secure, and reliable backend built from scratch in Rust.
* **Open API for Integrations:** We provide well-documented Open API routes, making it easy to build bots, integrate third-party clients, and extend Axon's functionality.

We believe in open communication and a powerful, developer-friendly ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Landing Page: Getting Started

To get the landing page up and running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/axon-chat/axon-landing.git
    cd axon-landing-page
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the landing page in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:8080` for this project.
    
4.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```
    This command will generate a `dist` folder with the optimized static assets for deployment.
